My parents immigrated to America from a small city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Located on the banks of the river Ghaghra and east of the state capital Lucknow, the town of Faizabad is a great part of my family history.

Visiting my parent’s hometown was always an adventure for me and my brother. Faizabad is a small city of close community which has its own charm. Every time I go to Chowk (the main market) with my mom, even after so many years she sees someone she knows. A population of around 165,000 people, with the majority being Hindus and Muslims. 

Gulab Bari translates to “garden of roses” and is home to the tomb of Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula, who ruled in the 1700s. I had the opportunity to visit this historical monument on one of my trips. Gulab Bari has a beautiful collection of various colored roses surrounding the sides of water fountains. Along the arched passages, Gulab Bari was used to host significant religious functions during the nawab's reign.

Well connected by rail and road, locals can easily travel by train to Lucknow, Delhi, and other cities in Northern India. The Faizabad airport is currently a government airstrip and there are plans to develop it into a domestic airport. I know that the next time I visit the city, Faizabad will have grown and I am excited to experience it all again.

I am grateful for the chance to learn my roots and see the culture that is part of my identity.
