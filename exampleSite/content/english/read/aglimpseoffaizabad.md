My parents immigrated to the U.S. from a small city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Located on the banks of the river Ghaghra and east of the state capital Lucknow, the town of Faizabad is a great part of my family history.
Visiting my parent’s hometown was always an adventure for me and my brother. Small cities have their own charm. Every time I go to the bazaar with my mom, even after so many years she sees someone she knows. Or later someone will tell my grandfather, “I saw your daughter at chowk!”
