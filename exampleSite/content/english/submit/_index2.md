## Interviewing Tips: 

### WIRF is built for you to post and share your family history. This includes:
* Short Family Stories
* Family Recipes
* Family History Timelines
* Oral History Recordings
* ...and more
### Most of these entries involve interviewing your family members to get more details on your desired story, recipe, or other topic. Below is a list of tips on how to do both long and short interviews with your family members:

### Interview Prep:

**Pre-Interview:**
1. Make a plan (time, date, location/virtual meeting) for the interview with your family member(s). This will help ensure that the interview will happen.
3. If relevant, have you or your family members bring any family items (photos, heirlooms, etc.) to the interview. These will likely trigger family stories. 
4. Allot the right amount of time for the interview (30 minutes for a single short story, up to 2 hours for a full life history). 
5. Do you want to record your interview? Or will you take notes? Decide your medium(s), get the needed supplies prior to the interview.
6. If relevant, do your world/national history research beforehand.
7. Craft some questions for the interview, or use our suggested questions list below as a reference during a longer interview.

**During Interview:**
1. Relax, don’t rush. Remember that this is just a conversation, and even if your interviewee is a distant relative, they want to be there.
2. Get dates for family stories. Most people won’t have an exact year, but if you can get an idea of how old they were when the story takes place, or you are able to locate it between national or international events, it will help you date it in your family history.
3. Monitor your interviewee’s cues, verbal and non-verbal, to know when to stop the interview and/or change the subject. If you enter a topic that you can tell is uncomfortable for your family member, be sure to let them know they can stop if they want. 
4. If you can tell your interviewee is getting tired, or is no longer in the mood to be interviewed, stop the interview. You can always schedule a second interview at a later date.

**Post-Interview:**
1. Thank your family member(s) for their time and if needed, schedule a follow-up interview.
2. Save any notes you took, and any recordings you made. Back up your files if possible.
