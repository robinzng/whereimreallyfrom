## Submission Tips: 

## WIRF is built for you to post and share your family history. This includes:

## * Short family stories
## * Family Recipes
## * Family History Timelines
## * Oral History Recordings
## * ...and more!*

## Donâ€™t know where to start? No problem! Refer to our Guidlines and Examples below, for an idea on what to do:

## Short family story:
## **Guidelines:**
## * Should be between roughly 100 and 2000 words.
## * Be sure to include pictures! 1-5 is ideal - if you have several, consider making a slideshow video, or collage picture.
## * Example: [name here](https://keen-shirley-2fbefd.netlify.app/tips)

## Family Recipes:
## **Guidelines:**
## * There is no specific word limit for this - but a step-by-step list (numbered) is ideal.
## * Be sure to include pictures! 1 per significant step is ideal,but not necessary - a picture of the finished product is required.
## * Example: [name here](https://keen-shirley-2fbefd.netlify.app/tips)

## Family History Timeline:
## **Guidelines:**
## * There is no specific word limit for this - an ideal format for contructing and sharing a timeline is a Powerpoint presentation.
## * Export your Power point presentation timeline as a video for easy presentation on the site.
## * Example: [Family History Timeline](https://keen-shirley-2fbefd.netlify.app/tips)

## Oral History Recordings:
## **Guidelines:**
## * There is no specific file size limit for this - but the WIRF editors will get back to you if we encounter issues with this.
## * Be sure to include pictures! 1-5 is ideal - if you have several, consider making a slideshow video, or collage picture.
