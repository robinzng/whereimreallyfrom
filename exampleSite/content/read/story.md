My father told me a story once.

About the time he saved a turtle. 

I was six or seven years old, sitting on the living room floor with my three older brothers, listening with rapt attention. 

The story begins on a hot day. My father was a prisoner of war in the re-education camps of Vietnam at the time. The prisoners weren’t fed very often so they had to find creative ways to get food, one of which was to set up animal traps. The prisoner in the cell next to my father’s had just caught a turtle in his trap. 

Feeling sorry for the turtle, my father asked his neighbor if he wanted to trade for the scallions that my father had been growing. The prisoner said something like, “Sure. I don’t know what to do with this thing anyway,” and tossed the turtle his way.

My father tied some leaves to the turtle’s bloodied leg and sent it limping off. After a few steps, it turned around and nodded to my father three times before walking away. He didn’t know what to make of it at the time, thinking it was odd, but three days later, my father was released from prison. 

Looking back, I guess it was pretty heavy for a bedtime story. 

But as children, my brothers and I didn’t really concern ourselves with the darker details. We didn’t know what war meant. And the word prisoner certainly did not exist in our vocabulary, in our limited understanding of the world as children. What we heard was a fairy tale of sorts. And a fable: my father saved a turtle’s life and it, in turn, saved his. 

It was the first time a story captivated me. I replayed it in my mind again and again and soon started telling my own stories, my own fairy tales.

My family and I immigrated from Vietnam to NYC in 1993, when I was three years old. My parents found work doing sweatshop labor at home, so that was my first job in America, at the age of three, helping my family sew ties and cummerbunds to make ends meet. Sometimes, we’d get behind in our quota and had mountains of ties or flight attendant scarves to get through. I remember making up stories in my head to motivate myself to get the job done. I’d separate the big pile into six smaller piles and pretend that each pile was a member of my family and that I had to save them from a burning building. One by one. The only way to save them was to do the work. One pile at a time.

Storytelling, myth-making was not just a way for me to survive, but also a way for me to understand my place in the world, a necessary means of perception when one straddles the line between many identities. And that would become increasingly crucial throughout my life as the hurdles I faced as an immigrant, as a female, as a poor person, became infinitely more difficult.

I never thought, however, that my stories would one day make their way into a book, and that that book would become a memoir of my life, set to publish on June 1st of this year. It has been featured in Vogue’s Best Books of 2021 list alongside literary luminaries such as Kazuo Ishiguro, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Chang-Rae Lee. 

To my fellow Asian community, my unsolicited advice is this: Tell your stories. In whatever language you speak, in the medium of your choosing. Tell your stories. Whether through words, through paint, through sculpture. Through photography, crochet, food, stickers, and memes. Through conversation, through dissent, through boba, tell your stories. Tell the stories of our people and let everyone know how powerful we are, that we come from a long line of warriors, that we come from legend. Tell your stories so that others, like myself, might have the courage to do so as well.
