So my grandmother died last year in September. It was a ten year battle with a disease hat attacked her white blood cells and eventually she just became weaker and weaker. Untilmately she passed away with a infection in one of her organs that spread throughout her body. I think about her everyday. 

I wanted to just share with everyone how beautiful my grandma was. I know a lot of us struggle with our Asian identities because of our diasporas. A lot of us feel like outsiders and are ashamed of our cultures. I never felt like that. I was always so so so proud of who I was. My favorite color was red because of the chinese flag as a child. I begged to go to China every year. I asked for chinese flags all the time. I was so proud of being chinese and I was never ever ashamed of it. I owe all to my 婆婆。 

She taught me all about chinese culture. She taught me about the beauty of who we are. All the amazing foods, the holidays, the values, and culture. She taught me chinese poetry that I can still recite to this day. One time she even asked her friend from China to ship over a red scarf that all the students wore in China so that I could wear it. She made me proud of who I was. This translated into every sector of my life. I’m queer and I was never ashamed of it. Kids used to bully me for being feminine and loving the arts but that never made me give up.

I remember when she would take me on the buses of NYC, she would talk loudly and wouldn’t care. When we went grocery shopping, we would lose each other and yell across the store to find one another again. She was the sweetest woman I’ve ever known yet strong and hard. Always said thank you but never took anyones bullshit.

I owe so much to her. Without her, I wouldn’t be as strong as I am today. Everyday when I am proud of who I am, I thank her. When I feel like an outsider, I am ashamed of feeling that way. I miss her everyday. 

For all of you out there who feel ashamed of your cultures, remember your families. They left everything they knew for a better life for you and for them. They endured so much hate and struggles. So if you ever look in the mirror and are ashamed of your identity, just remember those who came before you. They think you’re beautiful. You come from strength and beauty.
