Honor on your family! Honor on you! Honor on your cow! (At least for now)

Growing up in Malaysia, never could I have imagined I would fly halfway across the world to eventually work for Disney, let alone have them support my educational aspirations. Like many others in the group, I'm the first generation in my family to earn a Master's and Bachelor's Degree. I am beyond grateful to have been given this opportunity to prove myself and inspire others in my family. Let's see how long this can make my parents proud until I start bringing dishonor again ü•∫

(If you can't already tell, Mushu, the little lizar.....I mean DRAGON is my favorite Disney characterüêâ)
